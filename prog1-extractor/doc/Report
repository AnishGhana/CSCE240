This project consisted of parsing a 10-K file and reporting the statistics to an output file. We were to pick two companies and I picked Exxon Mobil and Berkshire Hathaway due to personal interest in the activities of these companies. The project was difficult until I simplified the input methods. Making the 10-K into a text file significantly reduced the difficulty of the project. It was much easier to parse the text files due to less variablility in the text files. I used Python due to my familiarity with the language. The hardest part of the project was figuring out a way to count the amount of parts in the 10-K. The 10-K has many instances of the word part so I could not just count those. Originally I attempted to use a regular expression (Part "space" roman numeral) to put the roman numerals in an array and then convert them to integers. I would then take the highest integer and call that the number of parts in the 10-K. I had difficulty making this work due to complexity so then I realized that in the table contents the word "PART" is capitalized and if you only count the fully capitalized versions of the word "PART" you get the number of parts int the 10-k. I also faced a little difficulty in outputing to a file, although is because of my lack of experience with file input and output in Python. I made the code check for invalid file names and invalid user inputs so it should be able to handle most scenarios. I also used many extra pieces of code that doesn't do a huge amount of work for this specific task, but I was reccomended to do on different Python websites as good coding ettiquette.
