	This project was more difficult for me than the first one, 
mostly due to the need to extensively use regular expressions in the project. I found myself using more complex 
python tools so that I could fine tune the program so that it would accurately take in user data and output parts 
of each company’s 10-K. I had two big methods, “parse_user_input” and “print_to_file”. I also had a “search” method. 
They each did what they said, with me calling on “print_to_file” often. I also made sure to address some of the issues 
I had with the last project, including having a greater number of comments. I realized that there are definitely 
benefits to using python as a programming language, as there are more libraries to pull from, and many of the tools 
provided in python are simpler to use than Java or C++. I have also realized that despite the expanse of content provided 
by python, C++ simply allows for greater ability to fine tune code. I definitely spent more time on this project than the
first one, but I believe my code is all the better for it.
